# AutonomousTest

This project simulates the trajectory of an autonomous vehicle by generating sensor signals expected during the vehicle's movement. It supports algorithms like FastSLAM, EKF (Extended Kalman Filter), and others to process these signals, providing both simulated and real-time vehicle positioning. The tool visually compares the actual and simulated positions to validate the performance of different localization algorithms.

## Features
- Simulates vehicle motion and sensor signals.
- Implements FastSLAM, EKF, and other localization algorithms.
- Visual comparison of real vs. simulated positions.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository** to your system.
2. **Run the Python scripts** to simulate and visualize the vehicleâ€™s trajectory (`main.py`).
